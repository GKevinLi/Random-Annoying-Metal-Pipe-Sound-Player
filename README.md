# Random-Annoying-Metal-Pipe-Sound-Player
Plays a random annoying metal pipe sound every so often. Useful if you like sleeping with your headphones on or if you just want a reminder to stay focused once in a while.

You can set it to a custom sound with custom volume as well as change the percentage chance (per second) of the sound playing.

Have fun being annoyed! (or annoying people if you're installing this on someone else's computer)
